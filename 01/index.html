WHEN I STEPPED OUT into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie
house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. I was wishing I
looked like Paul Newman--- he looks tough and I don't--- but I guess my own looks aren't
so bad. I have light-brown, almost-red hair and greenish-gray eyes. I wish they were
more gray, because I hate most guys that have green eyes, but I have to be content with
what I have. My hair is longer than a lot of boys wear theirs, squared off in back and long
at the front and sides, but I am a greaser and most of my neighborhood rarely bothers to
get a haircut. Besides, I look better with long hair.
</p>

<p>
I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no
reason except that I like to watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them
with the actors. When I see a movie with someone it's kind of uncomfortable, like having
someone read your book over your shoulder. I'm different that way. I mean, my secondoldest
brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going-on-seventeen, never cracks a book at all, and
my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in
a story or drawing a picture, so I'm not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies
and books the way I do. For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world
that did. So I loned it.</p>

<p>
Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda
is different from anybody; he understands everything, almost. Like he's never hollering at
me all the time the way Darry is, or treating me as if I was six instead of fourteen. I love
Soda more than I've ever loved anyone, even Mom and Dad. He's always happy-go-lucky
and grinning, while Darry's hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then, Darry's gone
through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapop'll never grow up at all. I
don't know which way's the best. I'll find out one of these days.</p>
<p>
Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly
wishing I had some company. Greasers can't walk alone too much or they'll get jumped, 
The$Outsiders,"S.E."Hinton 4
or someone will come by and scream "Greaser!" at them, which doesn't make you feel
too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the Socs. I'm not sure how you spell
it, but it's the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich kids. It's like the
term "greaser," which is used to class all us boys on the East Side.</p>
<p>
We're poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we're wilder, too. Not
like the Socs, who jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and
get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the
next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and
hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don't mean I do things like
that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mom and Dad were
killed in an auto wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So
Soda and I stay out of trouble as much as we can, and we're careful not to get caught
when we can't. I only mean that most greasers do things like that, just like we wear our
hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails out and wear leather
jackets and tennis shoes or boots. I'm not saying that either Socs orgreasers are better;
that's just the way things are.</p>

<p>
I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work.
They would have gone with me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just
can't sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his
life is enough without inspecting other people's. Or I could have gotten one of the gang to
come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and consider
family. We're almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood
like ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have
called Darry and he would have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit
Mathews--- one of our gang--- would have come to get me in his car if I had asked him,
but sometimes I just don't use my head. It drives my brother Darry nuts when I do stuff
like that, 'cause I'm supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high IQ and
everything, but I don't use my head. Besides, I like walking.</p>

<p>

I about decided I didn't like it so much, though, when I spotted that red Corvair
trailing me. I was almost two blocks from home then, so I started walking a little faster. I
had never been jumped, but I had seen Johnny after four Socs got hold of him, and it
wasn't pretty. Johnny was scared of his own shadow after that. Johnny was sixteen then.
</p>

<p>
I knew it wasn't any use though--- the fast walking, I mean--- even before the
Corvair pulled up beside me and five Socs got out. I got pretty scared--- I'm kind of small
for fourteen even though I have a good build, and those guys were bigger than me. I
automatically hitched my thumbs in my jeans and slouched, wondering if I could get
away if I made a break for it. I remembered Johnny--- his face all cut up and bruised, and
I remembered how he had cried when we found him, half-conscious, in the comer lot.
Johnny had it awful rough at home--- it took a lot to make him cry. </p>

<p>
I was sweating something fierce, although I was cold. I could feel my palms
getting clammy and the perspiration running down my back. I get like that when I'm real
scared. I glanced around for a pop bottle or a stick or something--- Steve Randle, Soda's
best buddy, had once held off four guys with a busted pop bottle--- but there was nothing.
So I stood there like a bump on a log while they surrounded me. I don't use my head.
They walked around slowly, silently, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, grease," one said in an over-friendly voice. "We're gonna do you a favor,
greaser. We're gonna cut all that long greasy hair off."</p>

<p>
He had on a madras shirt. I can still see it. Blue madras. One of them laughed,
then cussed me out in a low voice. I couldn't think of anything to say. There just isn't a
whole lot you can say while waiting to get mugged, so I kept my mouth shut.</p>

<p>
"Need a haircut, greaser?" The medium-sized blond pulled a knife out of his back
pocket and flipped the blade open.</p>

<p>
I finally thought of something to say. "No." I was backing up, away from that
knife. Of course I backed right into one of them. They had me down in a second. They
had my arms and legs pinned down and one of them was sitting on my chest with his 
knees on my elbows, and if you don't think that hurts, you're crazy. I could smell English
Leather shaving lotion and stale tobacco, and I wondered foolishly if I would suffocate
before they did anything. I was scared so bad I was wishing I would. I fought to get
loose, and almost did for a second; then they tightened up on me and the one on my chest
slugged me a couple of times. So I lay still, swearing at them between gasps. A blade was
held against my throat.</p>

<p>
"How'd you like that haircut to begin just below the chin?"</p>

<p>
It occurred to me then that they could kill me. I went wild. I started screaming for
Soda, Darry, anyone. Someone put his hand over my mouth, and I bit it as hard as I
could, tasting the blood running through my teeth. I heard a muttered curse and got
slugged again, and they were stuffing a handkerchief in my mouth. One of them kept
saying, "Shut him up, for Pete's sake, shut him up!"</p>

<p>
Then there were shouts and the pounding of feet, and the Socs jumped up and left
me lying there, gasping. I lay there and wondered what in the world was happening---
people were jumping over me and running by me and I was too dazed to figure it out.
Then someone had me under the armpits and was hauling me to my feet. It was Darry.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all right, Ponyboy?"
</p>

<p>
He was shaking me and I wished he'd stop. I was dizzy enough anyway. I could
tell it was Darry though--- partly because of the voice and partly because Darry's always
rough with me without meaning to be.</p>

<p>
"I'm okay. Quit shaking me, Darry, I'm okay."
</p>
<p>
He stopped instantly. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>
He wasn't really. Darry isn't ever sorry for anything he does. It seems funny to me
that he should look just exactly like my father and act exactly the opposite from him. My
father was only forty when he died and he looked twenty-five and a lot of people thought 

Darry and Dad were brothers instead of father and son. But they only looked alike--- my
father was never rough with anyone without meaning to be.</p>
<p>
Darry is six-feet-two, and broad-shouldered and muscular. He has dark-brown
hair that kicks out in front and a slight cowlick in the back--- just like Dad's--- but Darry's
eyes are his own. He's got eyes that are like two pieces of pale blue-green ice. They've
got a determined set to them, like the rest of him. He looks older than twenty--- tough,
cool, and smart. He would be real handsome if his eyes weren't so cold. He doesn't
understand anything that is not plain hard fact. But he uses his head.</p>
